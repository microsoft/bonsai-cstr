# OpenAI Gym Cart Pole Sample

A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The system is controlled by applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart. The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over. A reward of +1 is provided for every timestep that the pole remains upright. The episode ends when the pole is more than 15 degrees from vertical, or the cart moves more than 2.4 units from the center.

Simulators need two environment variables set to be able to attach to the platform.

The first is `SIM_ACCESS_KEY`. You can create one from the `Account Settings` page.
You have one chance to copy the key once it has been created. Make sure you don't enter
the ID.

The second is `SIM_WORKSPACE`. You can find this in the URL after `/workspaces/` once
you are logged in to the platform.

There is also an optional `SIM_API_HOST` key, but if it is not set it will default to `https://api.bons.ai`.

If you're launching your simulator from the command line, make sure that you have these two
environment variables set. If you like, you could use the following example script:

```sh
export SIM_WORKSPACE=<your-workspace-id>
export SIM_ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>
python3 cartpole_simulator.py
```
