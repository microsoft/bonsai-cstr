# OpenAI Gym Frozen Lake Sample
The agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile.

Simulators need two environment variables set to be able to attach to the platform.

The first is `SIM_ACCESS_KEY`. You can create one from the `Account Settings` page.
You have one chance to copy the key once it has been created. Make sure you don't enter
the ID.

The second is `SIM_WORKSPACE`. You can find this in the URL after `/workspaces/` once
you are logged in to the platform.

There is also an optional `SIM_API_HOST` key, but if it is not set it will default to `https://api.bons.ai`.

If you're launching your simulator from the command line, make sure that you have these two
environment variables set. If you like, you could use the following example script:

```sh
export SIM_WORKSPACE=<your-workspace-id>
export SIM_ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>
python3 frozenlake_simulator.py
```
