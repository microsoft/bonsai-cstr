# OpenAI Gym Taxi Sample
There are 4 locations (labeled by different letters) and your job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off in another. You receive +20 points for a successful dropoff, and lose 1 point for every timestep it takes. There is also a 10 point penalty for illegal pick-up and drop-off actions.

## Running Simulator

Simulators need two environment variables set to be able to attach to the platform.

The first is `SIM_ACCESS_KEY`. You can create one from the `Account Settings` page.
You have one chance to copy the key once it has been created. Make sure you don't enter
the ID.

The second is `SIM_WORKSPACE`. You can find this in the URL after `/workspaces/` once
you are logged in to the platform.

There is also an optional `SIM_API_HOST` key, but if it is not set it will default to `https://api.bons.ai`.

If you're launching your simulator from the command line, make sure that you have these two
environment variables set. If you like, you could use the following example script:

```sh
export SIM_WORKSPACE=<your-workspace-id>
export SIM_ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>
python3 taxi_simulator.py
```
