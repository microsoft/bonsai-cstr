# Overview
# The process considered here is a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) during transition from
# low to high conversion rate (high to low residual concentration). Because the chemical reaction
# is exothermic (produces heat), the reactor temperature must be controlled to prevent a thermal
# runaway. The control task is complicated by the fact that the process dynamics are nonlinear and
# transition from stable to unstable and back to stable as the conversion rate increases. The reactor
# dynamics are modeled in Simulink. The controlled variables (states) are the residual concentration Cr
# and the reactor temperature Tr, and the manipulated variable (action) is the temperature Tc of the
# coolant circulating in the reactor's cooling jacket.

# More details about the model are available at https://aka.ms/bonsai-chemicalprocessing
