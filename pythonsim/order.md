# STRATEGIES

# CSTR-Simulink
0. Gain-scheduled PID (via CSTR 1.0) (2 concepts + learned)

# CSTR-Python 

_classic_
1. Linear MPC
2. Nonlinear MPC

_bonsai: expertise-based composition_
3. Monolithic Brain (1 concept)
4. Modular Brain (3 concepts + programmed selector) # not in code base yet; poor performance
5. Modular Brain (3 concepts + learned selector)    # same as CSTR 1.0

_bonsai + expertise + multiple techniques_
6. Modular Brain + ML (uses constraints & random-forest)
7. Modular Brain + MPC
